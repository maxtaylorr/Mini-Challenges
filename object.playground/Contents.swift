/* Create a class called Dog.

Dog should have the following properties:

name (of type String)
owner (of type String)
age (of type Int)
Create an initializer to initialize all properties.
After you create an initializer, create a function called bark that takes no parameters and prints "Woof" to the console.
After the bark function is created, create a computed property called dogTag with type String. dogTag property should return a string saying "If lost, call " concatenated with the owners name.

Example of Dog:

let puppy = Dog(name: "Orion", owner: "Shawn", age: 1)
puppy.bark() // Prints "Woof"
print(puppy.dogTag) // Prints "If lost, call Shawn" */
